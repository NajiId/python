# Project Overview

This project comprises a Python script that analyzes user passwords stored in a CSV file, identifies compromised users, and performs various operations based on the analysis, such as generating new files and storing information in different formats.

## Code Functionality

The Python script performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading Data from CSV:**
   - Reads user passwords from a CSV file named `passwords.csv`.
   - Utilizes the `csv` module to parse the CSV data.

2. **Identifying Compromised Users:**
   - Extracts usernames from the CSV data and stores them in a list called `compromised_users`.

3. **Outputting Compromised Users:**
   - Prints the list of compromised users to the console.

4. **Writing Compromised Users to File:**
   - Saves the list of compromised users to a text file named `compromised_users.txt`.

5. **Creating a JSON Message:**
   - Constructs a JSON message addressed to "The Boss" indicating the success of a mission.
   - Writes this message to a JSON file named `boss_message.json`.

6. **Generating New Passwords:**
   - Produces a new CSV file named `new_passwords.csv`.
   - Writes a signature message to this CSV file.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the provided Python script and place it in your desired directory.

3. Place the `passwords.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

4. Execute the Python script.

## Additional Notes

- The script closes the opened files using the `with` statement, ensuring proper resource management.
- A signature message is included in the `new_passwords.csv` file for additional context.
